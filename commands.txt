delv - delete vertex and all edge connections
1 - list the graph
2 - print menu of commands
3 - get the number of vertices
4 - iterate the set of vertices
5 - given two vertices, find out whether there is an edge from the first one to the second one
6 - get the in degree and the out degree of a specified vertex
7 - parse (iterate) the set of outbound edges of a specified vertex
8 - parse the set of inbound edges of a specified vertex
9 - retrieve or modify the information (the integer) attached to a specified edge
10 - performs a topological sorting and finds a highest cost path between two given vertices
11 - finds a vertex cover of no more than twice the optimal number of vertices

show - to show a graphical representation of the graph
search - search for the shortest path between 2 vertices
ford - performs Bellman Ford's algorithm
